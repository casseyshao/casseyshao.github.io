                            Hello, my name is Cassey! I am an undergraduate student at University of Toronto, pursuing a major 
                            in computer engineering, a minor in business, and a certificate in artificial intelligence. I am currently
                            on my program's Professional Experience Year (PEY) Co-op program, where I am interning as a junior software 
                            developer at Edsembli Inc. On this page, I share my projects, interests, and more! 
                            Thanks so much for visiting!
                        </p>

                        <h3>Cat and Mouse Game (C)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Worked with a partner to build a game, where the user is a mouse who needs to avoid a cat and travel through a maze to reach a block of cheese. 
                            Used the DE1-SoC board for user inputs and to display game information.

                        <h3>Maps Application (C++)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Worked in a team of 3 to build a mapping program. 
                            Used EZGL (drawing package) and GTK to visualize the map UI. 
                            Used/extended an API querying OpenStreetMap database to obtain and display geographic information.

                        <h3>Text Conferencing (C)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Worked with a partner to implement a text conferencing application, where a conference is a list of registered users (clients) that are sending text messages to each other. 
                            The server and client processes were implemented.

                        <h3>Flying</h3>
                        <p>
                            I work part-time as a familiarization glider pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Cadet Program. 
                            In this role, I take cadets up for glider flights to introduce them to gliding, and hopefully inspire them to pursue their glider/private pilot licenses through the program.

                        <h3>School Community</h3>
                        <p>
                            I love being involved in my community and make time for it outside of my courses. 
                            I was a head leader for engineering orientation week, an executive for two years with Sustainable Engineers Association, and I played some games with the intramural girls’ hockey team.

                        <h3>Outdoor Activies</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am always excited to be outside and active! 
                            I worked as a snowboard instructor for the City of Toronto and played sports–such as ice hockey and soccer–growing up! 
                            I also really enjoy hiking, biking, swimming, and joining drop-in fitness classes at my school’s gym!
