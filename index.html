                            Hello, my name is Cassey! I am an undergraduate student at University of Toronto, pursuing a major 
                            in computer engineering, a minor in business, and a certificate in artificial intelligence. I previously
                            interned at Amazon as a software development engineer intern and edsembli Inc. as a junior software developer.
                            I enjoy problem solving, working with people, and working with technology!

                            <br><br>

                            I am currently in the fourth academic year of my program (4 academic years + 1 co-op year).
                            I work part-time as a glider familiarization pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Cadet Gliding Program.
                            I am also a Peer Coach for my faculty's Engineering Career Centre.

                            <br><br>

                            On this page, I share some of my projects and interests. Thanks so much for visiting my page!

                        <p>
                            My eFridge is a project for the food insecurity prompt at the ElleHacks 2022 hackathon.
                            The concept is an application which acts as a smart fridge to reduce food waste. It allows both, individual households 
                            and businesses which store food, to monitor their inventory and be notified of upcoming expiry dates for food.
                            The prototype is a webpage built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

                        <p>
                            Cat and Mouse Game is a project with the goal of maximizing use of the inputs and outputs on the Terasic 
                            DE1-SoC to display a game. This game requires the player, who is the mouse, to navigate through a
                            maze and reach a block of cheese, before the time ends and without touching the moving cat. 
                            This project was built using the C programming language.

                        <p>
                            This Maps Application consisted of exploring the considerations that go into designing map/GPS 
                            systems such as Google Maps. Some of my contributions included extending an API retrieving data 
                            from the OpenStreetMap database to return richer information (e.g., distance between two points) and 
                            visualizing the map (e.g., adding logic for displaying elements at various zoom levels).
                            This project was built using the C++ programming language.

                        <p>
                            Worked with a partner to implement a text conferencing application, where a conference is a list of registered users (clients) 
                            that are sending text messages to each other. The server and client processes were implemented.
                            This lab was built using the C programming language.

                        <p>
                            I work part-time as a familiarization glider pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Cadet Program. 
                            In this role, I take cadets up for glider flights to introduce them to gliding, and hopefully inspire them to pursue their glider/private pilot licenses through the program.

                            I love being involved in my community and make time for it outside of my courses. 
                            I was a head leader for engineering orientation week, an executive for two years with Sustainable Engineers Association, and I played some games with the intramural girls’ hockey team.

                            I am always excited to be outside and active! 
                            I worked as a snowboard instructor for the City of Toronto and played sports–such as ice hockey and soccer–growing up! 
                            I also really enjoy hiking, biking, swimming, and joining drop-in fitness classes at my school’s gym!
